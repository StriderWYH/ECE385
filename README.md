# ECE385
Our final project of ECE385 in ZJUI： cooperated with Yiming Li
In this final project, we present our respect to the classical Nintendo old game ’Battle-city’. Our game is
mainly focused on the function of 2 players. The two competitors are enabled to control the movement of
the tank by the keyboard, as well as shooting each other’s tanks and destroying the enemy’s base camp,
which implies there are at least 4 key could be pressed simultaneously on the single keyboard without
any conflicts. There would be medical kit appeared at the bottom of the screen, which could be used to
add exactly one blood unit to the base. Some wall blocks are destructible, therefore more ploys could be
possibly used to win the game. We implement this project on the FPGA board. In details, our design
will contains many parts including player controller, VGA controller, the color map and the loudspeaker
controller. And all these designs are based on SystemVerilog to simulate the circuit.
